/**
 * The Dual class represents a dual number of the form a + bùú∫, where ùú∫ has the property
 * that ùú∫ ‚â† 0 and ùú∫2 = 0. Dual numbers are useful for automatic differentiation,
 * because f(a + bùú∫) = f(a) + bf‚Äô(a)ùú∫. Each dual number keeps track of its real
 * component and its dual component. The dual class also tracks the largest difference
 * between two numbers that it considers still equal. Dual numbers support fairly
 * intuitive operations, including addition, subtraction, multiplication, division,
 * and reciprocation. A dual number can be raised to a power, or used as the exponent
 * of a number. The real or dual parts of a dual number can be extracted. Dual numbers
 * can be converted into a String and compared for equality by checking if the fields
 * are approximately equal.
